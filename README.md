## Overview

This paper explores the task of radiology report generation, which aims at generating free-text descriptions for a set of radiographs. One significant challenge of this task is how to correctly maintain the consistency between the images and the lengthy report. Previous research explored solving this issue through planning-based methods, which generate reports only based on high-level plans. However, these plans usually only contain the major observations from the radiographs (e.g., lung opacity), lacking much necessary information, such as the observation characteristics and preliminary clinical diagnoses. To address this problem, the system should also take the image information into account together with the textual plan and perform stronger reasoning during the generation process. In this paper, we propose an Observation-guided radiology Report Generation framework (**<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">ORGan</span>**). It first produces an observation plan and then feeds both the plan and radiographs for report generation, where an observation graph and a tree reasoning mechanism are adopted to precisely enrich the plan information by capturing the multi-formats of each observation. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods regarding text quality and clinical efficacy.

## Requirements

- `torch==1.9.1`
- `torchvision==0.10.1`
- `transformers==4.15.0`

## Pretrained and Trained Model Weights

Pretrained model weight for the IU X-ray dataset: [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BnnnwFf3TRba-frOMY8xQEz6YIFmCI-s/view?usp=sharing)

Trained model weights on the two datasets are available at:

- IU X-ray: [Coming Soon]()
- MIMIC-CXR: [Coming Soon]()

## Step 0: Data Preparation and Observation Plan/Graph Extraction

Please download the two datasets: [IU-Xray](https://openi.nlm.nih.gov/) and [MIMIC-CXR](https://physionet.org/content/mimic-cxr-jpg/2.0.0/). For observation preprocessing, we use [CheXbert](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.09167.pdf) to extract relevant observation information. Please follow the [instruction](https://github.com/stanfordmlgroup/CheXbert#prerequisites) to extract the observation tags.

### Step 0.1 Observation Graph Extraction

```
chmod +x ./src/graph_construction/run_iu_xray.sh
./src/graph_construction/run_iu_xray.sh
```

### Step 0.2 Observation Plan Extraction

```
cd ORGan
python ./src/plan_extraction.py
```

## Step 1: Observation Planning

There are two parameters required to run the code of the planner:

- `debug: whether debugging the code (0 for debugging and 1 for running)`
- `checkpoint_name: indicating the location for the pre-trained visual model, mainly for IU Xray dataset`.

```
chmod +x ./script_plan/run_iu_xray.sh
./script_plan/run_iu_xray.sh debug checkpoint_name
```

## Step 2: Observation-guided Report Generation

There are four parameters required to run the code of the generator:

- `debug: whether debugging the code (0 for debugging and 1 for running)`
- `checkpoint_name: indicating the location for the pre-trained visual model, mainly for the IUÔºçXray dataset, same as the setting of the planner`
- `plan_model_name_or_path: indicating the location of the trained planner (from Step 1)`
- `plan_eval_file: indicating the file name of generated plans for the validation set (from Step 1)`

```
chmod +x ./script/run_iu_xray.sh
./script/run_iu_xray.sh debug checkpoint_name plan_model_name_or_path plan_eval_file
```
